'''Write a Python function combinationSort ( strList ) that takes a list of unique strings strList as an
argument , where each string is a combination of a letter from a to z and a number from 0 to
99 , the initial character in string being the letter . For example a23 , d5 , q99 are some strings in
this format . This function should sorts the list and return two lists ( L1 , L2 ) in the order
mentioned below .
L1 : First list should contain all strings sorted in ascending order with respect to the first character
only . All strings with same initial character should be in the same order as in the original list .
L2 : In the list L1 above , sort the strings starting with same character , in descending order with
respect to the number formed by the remaining characters .'''

import string
def combinationSort(strList):
  # Create a dictionary with 26 keys from characters 'a' to 'z', each key has an empty list as value.
  groups = {k: [] for k in string.ascii_lowercase}

  # Using this dictionary to group strings with same initial character.  
  for i in range(len(strList)):
    char=strList[i][0]
    groups[char].append(strList[i])
  
  strList=[]
  # Recreate the list from all the strings in groups, iterating on groups from a to z.
  for char in groups.keys():
    for s in groups[char]:
      strList.append(s)
  
  L1 = strList.copy() # Saving intermediate result to return later.
  i = 1
  left = 0
  # As there can be no more than 100 strings with same initial character.
  # Using insertion sort within group.
  while i<len(strList):
    right = i
    while(right>left and strList[right][0] == strList[right-1][0] and int(strList[right-1][1:])<int(strList[right][1:])):
      strList[right], strList[right-1] = strList[right-1], strList[right]
      right -= 1
    i += 1
