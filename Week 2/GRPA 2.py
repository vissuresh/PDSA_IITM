'''Complete the python function find Largest ( L ) below , which accepts a list L of unique numbers ,
that are sorted ( ascending ) and rotated n times , where n is unknown , and returns the largest
number in list L. Rotating list [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ] one time gives us list [ 8 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 ] , and
rotating the second time gives list [ 7 , 8 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] and so on . Try to give an O ( log n ) solution .
Hint : One of the O ( log n ) solutions can be implemented using binary search and using ' first or
last ' element to know , the direction of searching further .'''

def findLargest(L):
  left = 0
  s = len(L)
  right = s-1
  
  # If list has only one element, that is the max.
  if (s==1):

  while (left<=right):
    mid=(left+right)//2
    
    # if mid is at last index, next element to compare will be at index 0
    if (mid == s-1):
      nextToMid = 0
    else:
      nextToMid = mid+1

    if (L[mid] > L[nextToMid]):
      return L[mid]
    elif (L[mid] < L[0]):
      # our element is in left of mid
